# Garry's Mod: Trolleybus System
## Version: Beta 1.1

Trolleybus Simulator addon for Garry's Mod.

Main features:
* Well-developed trolleybuses
* Catenary network system
* Routes system: trolleybus stops and passengers
* Simple traffic system
* Map created for trolleybuses
* Editor tools for creating infrastructure for trolleybuses

Mechanics of trolleybuses based on real world. The simulated elements consist of many subsystems (engine, circuits, announcer, control systems, etc). This will make you feel like a real trolleybus driver.

List of main trolleybuses:
* ZiU-682V-013
* ZiU-6205
* AKSM-101-PS
* AKSM-321 (few mods)
* AKSM-333 (few mods)
* TrolZa-5265

The catenary network is modelled to a high degree of detail. It contains main elements like wires, switches, crosses and etc. The trolleybuses and catenary network use electric circuit computations to simulate real world events.

Players can drive trolleybus routes to transport passengers between stops, also using the passenger information system when needed. In addition, this addon contains simple traffic systems that consist of AI traffic cars and traffic lights.

For this addon's default map we have created gm_sumy_reborn. It contains part of Sumy city and comes already configured for running trolleybuses, that means preconfigured a catenary network, trolleybus routes, stops, traffic lights, etc.

Players can use built-in tools on any map to create trolleybus infrastructure. Provided in-game editors are:
* Catenary network editor (for creating catenary network on map)
* Routes editor (for creating trolleybus stops and routes)
* Traffic tracks editor (for creating data used by AI traffic cars to navigate around the map)
* Traffic lights editor (for creating traffic lights in order to comply with traffic rules by trolleybuses and AI traffic cars)
* Announcer editor (for creating announcer sound lines used in trolleybus announcements)

The addon's API allows developers create their own trolleybuses and other elements, like custom AI cars. This API contains many functions and systems, classes and objects. This will make development easier.
