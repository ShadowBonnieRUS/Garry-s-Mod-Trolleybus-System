# Garry's Mod: Trolleybus System
## Version: Beta 1.0

Trolleybus Simulator addon for Garry's Mod.

Main features:
* Well-developed trolleybuses
* Contact network system
* Routes system: trolleybus stops and passengers
* Simple traffic system
* Map created for trolleybuses
* Editor tools for creating infrastructure for trolleybuses

Mechanics of trolleybuses based on real world. Controls contains many subsystems (engine, circuits, informers, control systems, etc). This will make you feel like a real trolleybus driver.

List of main trolleybuses:
* ZiU-682V-013
* ZiU-6205
* AKSM-101-PS
* AKSM-321 (few mods)
* AKSM-333 (few mods)
* TrolZa-5265

Contact network is strongly detailed. It contains main elements like wires, switches, crosses and etc. In trolleybuses and contact network used electric circuits computations to simulate real world events.

Players can use trolleybus route to transport passengers between stops, also using informer system when needed. In addition, addon contains simple traffic systems that consists of AI traffic cars and traffic lights.

For trolleybuses as default map created gm_sumy_reborn. It contains part of Sumy city and already configured to play with trolleybuses, so there is contact network, trolleybus routes, stops, traffic lights, etc.

Players can use built-in tools on any map to create trolleybus infrastructure. Provided in-game editors:
* Contact network editor (for creating contant network on map)
* Routes editor (for creating trolleybus stops and routes to use with)
* Traffic tracks editor (for creating data used by AI traffic cars to navigate around map)
* Traffic lights editor (for creating traffic lights in order to comply with traffic rules by trolleybuses and AI traffic cars)
* Informers editor (for creating informer sound lines used in trolleybus informers)

Addon's API allows developers create their own trolleybuses and other elements, like custom traffic cars. API contains many functions and systems, classes and objects. This will make development easier.
